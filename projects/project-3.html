<article>

  <p>
    The <strong>Mr. Harindu Housing Project</strong> is a private residential development consisting
    of a <strong>three-storey modern house</strong>. I provided complete electrical system design and
    technical consultancy services from the concept stage through to final design documentation.
    The electrical design was closely coordinated with architectural layouts to ensure
    functionality, safety, and long-term reliability.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope of Electrical Engineering Services</h2>

  <p>
    The scope of work included detailed <strong>electrical load calculations</strong>, taking into
    account connected load, maximum demand, and diversity factors to ensure correct sizing
    of the electrical infrastructure and to allow for future expansion across all three floors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Comprehensive <strong>lighting layouts and power distribution layouts</strong> were developed
    in accordance with the <strong>architect’s recommendations</strong>, ensuring compliance with
    residential lighting design standards, efficient power outlet placement, balanced
    illumination, and enhanced occupant comfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    Detailed <strong>single line diagrams (SLDs)</strong> were prepared to illustrate the complete
    <strong>electrical distribution system</strong>, including DB configurations, circuit protection
    devices, earthing arrangements, and load segregation, supporting safe installation and
    ease of maintenance.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Consulting for Buildings</h2>

  <p>
    I also provided <strong>electrical technical consulting</strong> for the project, covering low
    voltage electrical systems, electrical safety and protection coordination, residential power
    distribution across multiple floors, electrical design optimization, and coordination with
    architectural and MEP disciplines.
  </p>

  <h2>Tools & Standards</h2>

  <p>
    AutoCAD, IEC standards, residential electrical design guidelines,
    low voltage distribution practices, and building services engineering best practices.
