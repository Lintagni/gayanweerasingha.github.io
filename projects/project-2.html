  <p>
    In 2025, I completed several <strong>private residential electrical engineering projects</strong>,
    providing comprehensive <strong>electrical design and technical consulting services</strong>
    for housing developments. These projects focused on safe, efficient, and
    standards-compliant <strong>low voltage electrical systems</strong> aligned with architectural
    requirements and client expectations.
  </p>

  <h2>Morning Sun Villa – Residential Electrical Design</h2>
  <p>
    One of the key projects completed during this period was <strong>Morning Sun Villa</strong>,
    a private residential development. The electrical design was carried out in close coordination
    with the architectural layout to ensure functionality, aesthetics, and long-term reliability.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope of Electrical Engineering Services</h2>
  <p>
    The scope of work included detailed <strong>electrical load calculations</strong> to determine
    connected load, maximum demand, and future capacity requirements. Complete
    <strong>lighting and power layouts</strong> were prepared according to the
    <strong>architect’s recommendations</strong>, ensuring proper illumination levels,
    efficient socket placement, and user comfort throughout the building.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, <strong>single line diagrams (SLDs)</strong> were developed to clearly illustrate
    the <strong>electrical distribution system</strong>, protection devices, circuit segregation,
    and earthing arrangements, supporting safe installation and ease of maintenance.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Consulting for Buildings</h2>
  <p>
    I also provided <strong>electrical technical consulting for residential buildings</strong>,
    advising on system configuration, electrical safety, protection coordination,
    and practical implementation of design intent during the construction phase.
  </p>

  <h2>Tools & Standards</h2>
  <p>
    AutoCAD, IEC standards, residential electrical design guidelines,
    low voltage distribution practices, and building services engineering best practices.
